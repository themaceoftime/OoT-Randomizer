Layout of the EnItem00 actor variable in vanilla:
                 15       14                  8 7      0
| Give Immediately | Unused | Collectible Flag | Item Dropped | 

Layout of the EnItem00 actor variable after potsanity:

                 15          14 13                              8 7                               6 5            0
| Give Immediately | Drop Flag | Collectible Flag (lower 6 bits) | Collectible Flag (upper 2 bits) | Item Dropped |

Give Immediately - Used during EnItem00 init function to immediately give the collectible item to the player. Only used by wonderitems?
Drop Flag (new) - Indicates that the collectible was dropped (via a call to Item_DropCollectible or Item_DropCollectible2). Used to index a separate table for dropped overrides
Collectible Flag - Unique flag for the collectible. Combine lower 6 bits with upper 2 bits to produce the 8-bit flag as follows:
    ((Var & 0x3F00) >> 8) + (Var & 0x00C0)
Item Dropped - The item being dropped. This was reduced by 2 bits to extend the flag. 
    The highest value used is 25 (0b0001 1001) so we could even shave off another bit to double the available flag space.

During actor initialization, the initialization variable gets reduced to only the Item Dropped. 
The drop flag and upper 2 bits of the collectible flag are copied into the Actor dropFlag field (unused by this actor).
The layout of the dropFlag field as used by EnItem00 after potsanity:
 7      3 2                               1           0
| Unused | Collectible Flag (upper 2 bits) | Drop Flag | 

---------------------------------------
Flag tables
---------------------------------------
Flags for overridden collectible items are stored in two separate tables:
collectible_override_flags
and
dropped_collectible_override_flags

Flags are stored in these tables for each scene, in variable length chunks of 32-bits depending on how many flags are used in a particular scene.
Up to a maximum of 8 32-bit DWORDs for each scene to support up to 256 flags.
The entry point in the table for a particular scene is defined in collectible_scene_flags_table and dropped_collectible_scene_flags_table, 
which are dynamically generated by the randomizer depending upon the settings chosen.

                     31         30  ...           1          0
DWORD 0:    | Flag 31  | Flag 30  | ... |   Flag 1 |   Flag 0 |
DWORD 1:    | Flag 63  | Flag 62  | ... |  Flag 33 |  Flag 32 | 
                                    ...
DWORD 7:    | Flag 255 | Flag 254 | ... | Flag 225 | Flag 224 |

To retreive a particular flag from the table:
(flag_table[scene_table[scene] + (extended_flag / 32)] & (1 << (extended_flag % 32)))

Where:
flag_table - either collectible_override_flags or dropped_collectible_override_flags depending on the value of drop flag.
scene_table - Either collectible_scene_flags_table or dropped_collectible_scene_flags_table depending on the value of drop flag.
extended_flag - The 8-bit flag
scene - The current scene.
