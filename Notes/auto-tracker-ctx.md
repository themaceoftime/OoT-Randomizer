The **auto-tracker context** is a region of memory where a portion of the randomizer's configuration variables are stored in a versioned layout defined below. Its intent is to give some symbols added by the randomizer well-defined addresses so that auto-trackers can read them reliably without needing the symbols.json for the specific randomizer version that was used to generate the seed.

The starting address of the auto-tracker context is listed at address `0x8040_000c` (randomizer context + `0xc`). On versions of the randomizer before this feature was added, the starting address is given as zero. At that address, the following data can be found:

|Offset|Name|Min version|Size|Description|
|--:|---|--:|--:|---|
|`0x00`|`AUTO_TRACKER_VERSION`|1|`0x04`|Defines which entries in this table are available. Future versions may also change the layout of this table in an incompatible manner. The current version is 3.|
|`0x04`|`CFG_DUNGEON_INFO_ENABLE`|1|`0x04`|Defines how information about dungeons will be displayed on the inventory screen on the pause menu. `0` = disabled, `1` = a single menu shown when holding A, `2` = separate menus shown when holding D-pad buttons.|
|`0x08`|`CFG_DUNGEON_INFO_MQ_ENABLE`|1|`0x04`|`1` if the dungeon info in the pause menu should include info about which dungeons are in Master Quest mode.|
|`0x0c`|`CFG_DUNGEON_INFO_MQ_NEED_MAP`|1|`0x04`|`1` if the Master Quest info should only be displayed for dungeons whose maps have been obtained or which don't have maps.|
|`0x10`|`CFG_DUNGEON_INFO_REWARD_ENABLE`|1|`0x04`|`1` if the dungeon info in the pause menu should include info about which medallions and stones are in which dungeon.|
|`0x14`|`CFG_DUNGEON_INFO_REWARD_NEED_COMPASS`|1|`0x04`|Defines which item is required to display the location of a dungeon reward in the pause menu. `0` = no item required, `1` = the compass of the dungeon in which the reward is found, `2` = the compass of the reward's vanilla dungeon. For example, if the Kokiri Emerald is in the Fire Temple, `1` means the Fire Temple compass is required and `2` means the Deku Tree compass is required.|
|`0x18`|`CFG_DUNGEON_INFO_REWARD_NEED_ALTAR`|1|`0x04`|`1` if the reward info should only be displayed for rewards whose Temple of Time altar text boxes have been read.|
|`0x1c`|`CFG_DUNGEON_REWARDS`|1|`0x0e`|A byte representing the medallion or stone for each dungeon. Dungeons without rewards are listed as `0xff`, and one reward is chosen arbitrarily if the dungeon has multiple rewards. For more complete data, use `CFG_DUNGEON_REWARD_AREAS` instead.|
|`0x2a`|`CFG_DUNGEON_IS_MQ`|1|`0x0e`|A byte set to `1` for each dungeon in Master Quest mode.|
|`0x38`|`RAINBOW_BRIDGE_CONDITION`|2|`0x04`|The condition for spawning the rainbow bridge. `0` = open, `1` = medallions, `2` = dungeon rewards, `3` = stones, `4` = vanilla, `5` = tokens, `6` = hearts.|
|`0x3c`|`LACS_CONDITION`|2|`0x04`|The condition for triggering the light arrow cutscene. `0` = vanilla, `1` = medallions, `2` = dungeons, `3` = stones, `4` = tokens, `5` = hearts.|
|`0x40`|`RAINBOW_BRIDGE_COUNT`|2|`0x02`|The number of items (of the kind defined in `RAINBOW_BRIDGE_CONDITION`) required to spawn the rainbow bridge.|
|`0x42`|`LACS_CONDITION_COUNT`|2|`0x02`|The number of items (of the kind defined in `LACS_CONDITION`) required to trigger the light arrow cutscene.|
|`0x44`|`TRIFORCE_HUNT_ENABLED`|2|`0x02`|`1` if Triforce hunt is enabled.|
|`0x46`|`TRIFORCE_PIECES_REQUIRED`|2|`0x02`|In Triforce hunt, the total number of Triforce pieces (across all worlds) required to win the game.|
|`0x48`|`SPECIAL_DEAL_COUNTS`|2|`0x08`|A byte representing the number of special deal slots in each shop, in the following order: KF Shop, Market Bazaar, Market Potion Shop, Market Bombchu Shop, Kak Bazaar, Kak Potion Shop, GC Shop, ZD Shop.|
|`0x50`|`CFG_DUNGEON_REWARD_AREAS`|3|`0xcf`|For each dungeon reward in the order of Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire, Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, and Spirit, a null-terminated `0x16`-byte (`0x17` including the null terminator) ASCII string containing the hint area of that reward, padded with spaces on the right.|
